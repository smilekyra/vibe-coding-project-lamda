# File Creation Rules for Golang Projects

## CRITICAL: DO NOT CREATE these files unless explicitly requested:

1. **Markdown Documentation Files**
   - ❌ DO NOT create: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, or ANY .md files
   - ✅ Only create when user explicitly says "create a README" or "add documentation"

2. **Example Files**
   - ❌ DO NOT create: example.go, examples.go, *_example.go, or any example files
   - ✅ Only create when user specifically requests example code

## What TO Create:

- Only files directly requested by the user
- Core application files needed for the specific task
- Files essential to the implementation being built

## When in doubt:

- Ask "Should I create additional documentation?" before generating .md files
- Focus on implementing the requested feature, not creating boilerplate
```

### How to Access:

- Open Cursor Settings → General → **Project Rules**
- Or use Command Palette: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → "Add Project Rule"

## Alternative: Legacy Method (`.cursorrules`)

If you prefer the simpler old method (still works but will be removed eventually):

Create **`.cursorrules`** in your project root:
```
# Golang Project - File Creation Rules

## DO NOT CREATE unless explicitly requested:
- README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or ANY markdown files (.md)
- example.go, examples.go, or ANY example files

## Only create files that are:
1. Directly requested by the user
2. Essential for the specific implementation task
3. Core application code (main.go, services, handlers, etc.)

When in doubt, ASK before creating documentation or example files.
Focus on implementing the requested feature ONLY.
```

## Global User Rules (Optional)

For rules that apply to **all your projects**:

1. Go to **Cursor Settings** → **General** → **Rules for AI**
2. Add:
```
Be concise. Never create markdown documentation or example files unless explicitly requested.
