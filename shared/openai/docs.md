Process image inputs

Use our models' vision capabilities to analyze images.

](#analyze-images)

In this guide, you will learn about building applications involving images with the OpenAI API. If you know what you want to build, find your use case below to get started. If you're not sure where to start, continue reading to get an overview.

### A tour of image-related use cases

Recent language models can process image inputs and analyze them — a capability known as **vision**. With `gpt-image-1`, they can both analyze visual inputs and create images.

The OpenAI API offers several endpoints to process images as input or generate them as output, enabling you to build powerful multimodal applications.

|API|Supported use cases|
|---|---|
|Responses API|Analyze images and use them as input and/or generate images as output|
|Images API|Generate images as output, optionally using images as input|
|Chat Completions API|Analyze images and use them as input to generate text or audio|

To learn more about the input and output modalities supported by our models, refer to our [models page](/docs/models).

Generate or edit images
-----------------------

You can generate or edit images using the Image API or the Responses API.

Our latest image generation model, `gpt-image-1`, is a natively multimodal large language model. It can understand text and images and leverage its broad world knowledge to generate images with better instruction following and contextual awareness.

In contrast, we also offer specialized image generation models - DALL·E 2 and 3 - which don't have the same inherent understanding of the world as GPT Image.

You can learn more about image generation in our [Image generation](/docs/guides/image-generation) guide.

### Using world knowledge for image generation

The difference between DALL·E models and GPT Image is that a natively multimodal language model can use its visual understanding of the world to generate lifelike images including real-life details without a reference.

For example, if you prompt GPT Image to generate an image of a glass cabinet with the most popular semi-precious stones, the model knows enough to select gemstones like amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc, and depict them in a realistic way.

Analyze images
--------------

**Vision** is the ability for a model to "see" and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some [limitations](/docs/guides/images-vision#limitations).

### Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests either by providing a fully qualified URL to an image file, or providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL.

You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the `content` array, but keep in mind that [images count as tokens](/docs/guides/images-vision#calculating-costs) and will be billed accordingly.

Passing a URL

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: [
            { type: "text", text: "What is in this image?" },
            {
                type: "image_url",
                image_url: {
                    url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
                },
            },
        ],
    }],
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",

Passing a Base64 encoded image

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const imagePath = "path_to_your_image.jpg";
const base64Image = fs.readFileSync(imagePath, "base64");

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: [
            { type: "text", text: "what's in this image?" },
            {
                type: "image_url",
                image_url: {
                    url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`,
                },
            },
        ],
    }],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

# Path to your image
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# Getting the Base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                { "type": "text", "text": "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}",

            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

```bash

### Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.

|Supported file types|PNG (.png) - JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg) - WEBP (.webp) - Non-animated GIF (.gif)|
|Size limits|Up to 50 MB total payload size per request - Up to 500 individual image inputs per request|
|Other requirements|No watermarks or logos - No NSFW content - Clear enough for a human to understand|

### Specify image input detail level

The `detail` parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (`low`, `high`, or `auto` to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use `auto`.

```plain
"image_url": {
    "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
    "detail": "high"
},
```

You can save tokens and speed up responses by using `"detail": "low"`. This lets the model process the image with a budget of 85 tokens. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image. This is fine if your use case doesn't require the model to see with high-resolution detail (for example, if you're asking about the dominant shape or color in the image).

On the other hand, you can use `"detail": "high"` if you want the model to have a better understanding of the image.

Read more about calculating image processing costs in the [Calculating costs](/docs/guides/images-vision#calculating-costs) section below.

Limitations
-----------

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it's important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

*   **Medical images**: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
*   **Non-English**: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
*   **Small text**: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
*   **Rotation**: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
*   **Visual elements**: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
*   **Spatial reasoning**: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
*   **Accuracy**: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
*   **Image shape**: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
*   **Metadata and resizing**: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
*   **Counting**: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
*   **CAPTCHAS**: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.

Calculating costs
-----------------

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

### GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, o4-mini

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens based on their dimensions. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

A. Calculate the number of 32px x 32px patches that are needed to fully cover the image (a patch may extend beyond the image boundaries; out-of-bounds pixels are treated as black.)

```text
raw_patches = ceil(width/32)×ceil(height/32)
```

B. If the number of patches exceeds 1536, we scale down the image so that it can be covered by no more than 1536 patches

```text
r = √(32²×1536/(width×height))
r = r × min( floor(width×r/32) / (width×r/32), floor(height×r/32) / (height×r/32) )
```

C. The token cost is the number of patches, capped at a maximum of 1536 tokens

```text
image_tokens = ceil(resized_width/32)×ceil(resized_height/32)
```

D. Apply a multiplier based on the model to get the total tokens.

|Model|Multiplier|
|---|---|
|gpt-5-mini|1.62|
|gpt-5-nano|2.46|
|gpt-4.1-mini|1.62|
|gpt-4.1-nano|2.46|
|o4-mini|1.72|

**Cost calculation examples**

*   A 1024 x 1024 image is **1024 tokens**
    *   Width is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Height is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Tokens calculated as `32 * 32 = 1024`, below the cap of 1536
*   A 1800 x 2400 image is **1452 tokens**
    *   Width is 1800, resulting in `(1800 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 57` patches
    *   Height is 2400, resulting in `(2400 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 75` patches
    *   We need `57 * 75 = 4275` patches to cover the full image. Since that exceeds 1536, we need to scale down the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
    *   We can calculate the shrink factor as `sqrt(token_budget × patch_size^2 / (width * height))`. In our example, the shrink factor is `sqrt(1536 * 32^2 / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603`.
    *   Width is now 1086, resulting in `1086 / 32 = 33.94` patches
    *   Height is now 1448, resulting in `1448 / 32 = 45.25` patches
    *   We want to make sure the image fits in a whole number of patches. In this case we scale again by `33 / 33.94 = 0.97` to fit the width in 33 patches.
    *   The final width is then `1086 * (33 / 33.94) = 1056)` and the final height is `1448 * (33 / 33.94) = 1408`
    *   The image now requires `1056 / 32 = 33` patches to cover the width and `1408 / 32 = 44` patches to cover the height
    *   The total number of tokens is the `33 * 44 = 1452`, below the cap of 1536

### GPT 4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with `"detail": "low"` costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model (see chart below). To calculate the cost of an image with `"detail": "high"`, we do the following:

*   Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
*   Scale so that the image's shortest side is 768px long
*   Count the number of 512px squares in the image—each square costs a set amount of tokens (see chart below)
*   Add the base tokens to the total

|Model|Base tokens|Tile tokens|
|---|---|---|
|gpt-5, gpt-5-chat-latest|70|140|
|4o, 4.1, 4.5|85|170|
|4o-mini|2833|5667|
|o1, o1-pro, o3|75|150|
|computer-use-preview|65|129|

**Cost calculation examples (for gpt-4o)**

*   A 1024 x 1024 square image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 765 tokens
    *   1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
    *   4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is `170 * 4 + 85 = 765`.
*   A 2048 x 4096 image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 1105 tokens
    *   We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
    *   6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is `170 * 6 + 85 = 1105`.
*   A 4096 x 8192 image in `"detail": "low"` most costs 85 tokens
    *   Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.

### GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. The price depends on the dimensions of the image and the [input fidelity](/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1#input-fidelity).

When input fidelity is set to low, the base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens. When using high input fidelity, we add a set number of tokens based on the image's aspect ratio in addition to the image tokens described above.

*   If your image is square, we add 4160 extra input image tokens.
*   If it is closer to portrait or landscape, we add 6240 extra tokens.

To see pricing for image input tokens, refer to our [pricing page](/docs/pricing#latest-models).

* * *

We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit.

Structured model outputs
========================

Ensure text responses from the model adhere to a JSON schema you define.

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    { role: "user", content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
});

const event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
```

### Supported models

Structured Outputs is available in our [latest large language models](/docs/models), starting with GPT-4o. Older models like `gpt-4-turbo` and earlier may use [JSON mode](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode) instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response\_format

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

1.  When using [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling)
2.  When using a `json_schema` response format

Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via `response_format` are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

*   If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling - If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured `response_format`

The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the

[

Function Calling

](/docs/guides/function-calling#function-calling-with-structured-outputs)

guide.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode

Structured Outputs is the evolution of [JSON mode](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode). While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherence. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API, Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` is only supported with the `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, and `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model snapshots and later.

||Structured Outputs|JSON Mode|
|---|---|---|
|Outputs valid JSON|Yes|Yes|
|Adheres to schema|Yes (see supported schemas)|No|
|Compatible models|gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later|gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models|
|Enabling|response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }|response_format: { type: "json_object" }|

Examples
--------

Chain of thought

### Chain of thought

You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed

Structured data extraction

### Structured data extraction

You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as research papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure." },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
});

const research_paper = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[

UI generation

### UI Generation

You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const UI = z.lazy(() =>
  z.object({
    type: z.enum(["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]),
    label: z.string(),
    children: z.array(UI),
    attributes: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        value: z.string(),
      })
    ),
  })
);

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "Make a User Profile Form" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(UI, "ui"),
});

const ui = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum

    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild() # This is required to enable recursive types

Moderation

### Moderation

You can classify inputs on multiple categories, which is a common way of doing moderation.

Moderation using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ContentCompliance = z.object({
  is_violating: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["violence", "sexual", "self_harm"]).nullable(),
  explanation_if_violating: z.string().nullable(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Determine if the user input violates specific guidelines and explain if they do." },
    { role: "user", content: "How do I prepare for a job interview?" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(ContentCompliance, "content_compliance"),
});

const compliance = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Category(str, Enum):
    violence = "violence"
    sexual = "sexual"
    self_harm = "self_harm"

class ContentCompliance(BaseModel):
    is_violating: bool
    category: Optional[Category]
    explanation_if_violating: Optional[str]

          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### Example response

```json

  "category": null,
  "explanation_if_violating": null
}
```

How to use Structured Outputs with response\_format
---------------------------------------------------

You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.

**Note:** for fine tuned models, the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency. Other models do not have this limitation.

SDK objects

Step 1: Define your object

First you must define an object or data structure to represent the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

For example, you can define an object like this:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathResponse(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str
```

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathResponse = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});
```

#### Tips for your data structure

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your object in the API call

You can use the `parse` method to automatically parse the JSON response into the object you defined.

Under the hood, the SDK takes care of supplying the JSON schema corresponding to your data structure, and then parsing the response as an object.

```python
completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathResponse
  )
```

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathResponse, "math_response"),
});
```

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: {
      type: "json_schema",
      json_schema: {
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    },
    max_tokens: 50,
  });

  if (completion.choices[0].finish_reason === "length") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = completion.choices[0].message;

  if (math_response.refusal) {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.content) {

Manual schema

Step 1: Define your schema

First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

#### Tips for your JSON Schema

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call

To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

```json
response_format: { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": … , "strict": true }
```

For example:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "math_response",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "steps": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                "output": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                            "additionalProperties": False
                        }
                    },
                    "final_answer": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            },
            "strict": True
        }
    }
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
        { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" }
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        json_schema: {
            name: "math_response",
            schema: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                    steps: {
                        type: "array",
                        items: {
                            type: "object",
                            properties: {
                                explanation: { type: "string" },
                                output: { type: "string" }
                            },
                            required: ["explanation", "output"],
                            additionalProperties: false
                        }
                    },
                    final_answer: { type: "string" }
                },
                required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
                additionalProperties: false
            },
            strict: true
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      }
    ],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "math_response",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "steps": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "explanation": { "type": "string" },
                  "output": { "type": "string" }
                },
                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                "additionalProperties": false
              }
            },
            "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    store: true,
    response_format: {
      type: "json_schema",
      json_schema: {
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    },
    max_tokens: 50,
  });

  if (completion.choices[0].finish_reason === "length") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = completion.choices[0].message;

  if (math_response.refusal) {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.content) {
    console.log(math_response.content);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}
```

```python
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
        ],
        response_format={
            "type": "json_schema",
            "json_schema": {
                "name": "math_response",
                "strict": True,
                "schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "steps": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {
                                    "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                    "output": {"type": "string"},
                                },
                                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                                "additionalProperties": False,
                            },
                        },
                        "final_answer": {"type": "string"},
                    },
                    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
            },
        },
        strict=True,
    )
except Exception as e:
    # handle errors like finish_reason, refusal, content_filter, etc.
    pass
```

Step 4: Use the generated structured data in a type-safe way

Typically, when using Structured Outputs you will have a type or class in the type-system of your programming language representing the JSON Schema as an object.

Once you have confirmed that you have received the JSON guaranteed to match the schema you requested, you can now safely parse it to the corresponding type.

For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
from typing import List

# Define types that match the JSON Schema using pydantic models
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class Solution(BaseModel):
    steps: List[Step]
    final_answer: str

...

try:
    # Parse and validate the response content
    solution = Solution.parse_raw(response.choices[0].message.content)
    print(solution)
except ValidationError as e:
    # Handle validation errors
    print(e.json())
```

```javascript
// Here we specify types in TypeScript that exactly match the JSON Schema we provided when calling the OpenAI API. Note that these *must* be kept in sync.

type Step = {
  explanation: string;
  output: string;
};

type Solution = {
  steps: Step[];
  final_answer: string;
};

...

// Now so long as the JSON Schema we created was exactly equivalent to our TypeScript types, this is type-safe
const solution = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content)) as Solution
```

### 

Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in `response_format`, the API response will include a new field called `refusal` to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the `refusal` property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

```python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
steps: list[Step]
final_answer: str

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
{"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
],
response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message

if (math_reasoning.refusal):
print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
print(math_reasoning.parsed)
```

```javascript
const Step = z.object({
explanation: z.string(),
output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
steps: z.array(Step),
final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
messages: [
{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
{ role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
],
response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}
```

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-9nYAG9LPNonX8DAyrkwYfemr3C8HC",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1721596428,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 81,
    "completion_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 92,
    "completion_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0,
      "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,
      "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0
    }
  },
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_3407719c7f"
}
```

### 

Tips and best practices

#### Handling user-generated input

If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

#### Handling mistakes

Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

#### Avoid JSON schema divergence

To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
---------

You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs.

You can find an example of how to stream function call arguments without the SDK `stream` helper in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling#advanced-usage).

Here is how you can stream a model response with the `stream` helper:

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
    attributes: List[str]
    colors: List[str]
    animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
        },
    ],
    response_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "content.delta":
            if event.parsed is not None:
                # Print the parsed data as JSON
                print("content.delta parsed:", event.parsed)
        elif event.type == "content.done":
            print("content.done")
        elif event.type == "error":
            print("Error in stream:", event.error)

final_completion = stream.get_final_completion()
print("Final completion:", final_completion)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";
export const openai = new OpenAI();

const EntitiesSchema = z.object({
  attributes: z.array(z.string()),
  colors: z.array(z.string()),
  animals: z.array(z.string()),
});

const stream = openai.beta.chat.completions
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "Extract entities from the input text" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content:
          "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
      },
    ],
    response_format: zodResponseFormat(EntitiesSchema, "entities"),
  })
  .on("refusal.done", () => console.log("request refused"))
  .on("content.delta", ({ snapshot, parsed }) => {
    console.log("content:", snapshot);
    console.log("parsed:", parsed);
    console.log();
  })
  .on("content.done", (props) => {
    console.log(props);
  });

await stream.done();

const finalCompletion = await stream.finalChatCompletion();

console.log(finalCompletion);
```

You can also use the `stream` helper to parse function call arguments:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

class GetWeather(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str

client = OpenAI()

with client.beta.chat.completions.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather like in SF and London?",
        },
    ],
    tools=[
        openai.pydantic_function_tool(GetWeather, name="get_weather"),
    ],
    parallel_tool_calls=True,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.delta" or event.type == "tool_calls.function.arguments.done":
            print(event)

print(stream.get_final_completion())
```

```javascript
import { zodFunction } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import OpenAI from "openai/index";
import { z } from "zod";

const GetWeatherArgs = z.object({
  city: z.string(),
  country: z.string(),
});

const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = client.beta.chat.completions
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What's the weather like in SF and London?",
      },
    ],
    tools: [zodFunction({ name: "get_weather", parameters: GetWeatherArgs })],
  })
  .on("tool_calls.function.arguments.delta", (props) =>
    console.log("tool_calls.function.arguments.delta", props)
  )
  .on("tool_calls.function.arguments.done", (props) =>
    console.log("tool_calls.function.arguments.done", props)
  )
  .on("refusal.delta", ({ delta }) => {
    process.stdout.write(delta);
  })
  .on("refusal.done", () => console.log("request refused"));

const completion = await stream.finalChatCompletion();

console.log("final completion:", completion);
```

Supported schemas
-----------------

Structured Outputs supports a subset of the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) language.

#### Supported types

The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

*   String
*   Number
*   Boolean
*   Integer
*   Object
*   Array
*   Enum
*   anyOf

#### Supported properties

In addition to specifying the type of a property, you can specify a selection of additional constraints:

**Supported `string` properties:**

*   `pattern` — A regular expression that the string must match.
*   `format` — Predefined formats for strings. Currently supported:
    *   `date-time`
    *   `time`
    *   `date`
    *   `duration`
    *   `email`
    *   `hostname`
    *   `ipv4`
    *   `ipv6`
    *   `uuid`

**Supported `number` properties:**

*   `multipleOf` — The number must be a multiple of this value.
*   `maximum` — The number must be less than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMaximum` — The number must be less than this value.
*   `minimum` — The number must be greater than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMinimum` — The number must be greater than this value.

**Supported `array` properties:**

*   `minItems` — The array must have at least this many items.
*   `maxItems` — The array must have at most this many items.

Here are some examples on how you can use these type restrictions:

String Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "user_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The name of the user"
            },
            "username": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The username of the user. Must start with @",
                "pattern": "^@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
            },
            "email": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The email of the user",
                "format": "email"
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "name", "username", "email"
        ]
    }
}
```

Number Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "weather_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            },
            "value": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The actual temperature value in the location",
                "minimum": -130,
                "maximum": 130
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit", "value"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note these constraints are [not yet supported for fine-tuned models](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported).

#### Root objects must not be `anyOf` and must be an object

Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use `anyOf`. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an `anyOf` at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
BaseResponseSchema,
UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
```

#### All fields must be `required`

To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as `required`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
```

Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with `null`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size

A schema may have up to 5000 object properties total, with up to 10 levels of nesting.

#### Limitations on total string size

In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 120,000 characters.

#### Limitations on enum size

A schema may have up to 1000 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 15,000 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

#### `additionalProperties: false` must always be set in objects

`additionalProperties` controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set `additionalProperties: false` to opt into Structured Outputs.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Key ordering

When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

#### Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported

*   **Composition:** `allOf`, `not`, `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, `if`, `then`, `else`

For fine-tuned models, we additionally do not support the following:

*   **For strings:** `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`
*   **For numbers:** `minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`
*   **For objects:** `patternProperties`
*   **For arrays:** `minItems`, `maxItems`

If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying `strict: true` and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

#### For `anyOf`, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset

Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "item": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The user object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the user"
                        },
                        "age": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "The age of the user"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "name",
                        "age"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The address object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "number": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
                        },
                        "street": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
                        },
                        "city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The city of the address"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "number",
                        "street",
                        "city"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "item"
    ]
}
```

#### Definitions are supported

You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "steps": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
            }
        },
        "final_answer": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "step": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "explanation": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "output": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "explanation",
                "output"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "steps",
        "final_answer"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### Recursive schemas are supported

Sample recursive schema using `#` to indicate root recursion.

```json
{
    "name": "ui",
    "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The type of the UI component",
                "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
            },
            "label": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
            },
            "children": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Nested UI components",
                "items": {
                    "$ref": "#"
                }
            },
            "attributes": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The value of the attribute"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": ["name", "value"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "linked_list": {
            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "linked_list_node": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "value": {
                    "type": "number"
                },
                "next": {
                    "anyOf": [
                        {
                            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "null"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
                "next",
                "value"
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "linked_list"
    ]
}
```

JSON mode
---------

JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Chat Completions, set the `response_format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

*   When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
*   JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
*   Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)

Handling edge cases

```javascript
const we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens = true;

try {
